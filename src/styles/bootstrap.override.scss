/**
 * This purpose of this file is to override bootstrap's default variables.
 * 
 * It is necessary the overrides are imported BEFORE the core of bootstrap 
 * as this ensures availability during development.
 *
 * Accessing these specific variables within components will not work, 
 * unless added to the svelte-preprocess scss data property. 
 *
 * Accessing the bootstrap variables directly will not work as expected, 
 * the cognitive bandwidth required is instead delegated to separating 
 * concerns as explained below.
 * 
 * As a best practice, I allocate this file to only handle overriding the 
 * bootstrap variables and designate a separate variables.scss file to handle
 * variables unrelated to bootstrap. The variables.scss file is added to the 
 * svelte-preprocess scss data property to allow access throughout the app.
